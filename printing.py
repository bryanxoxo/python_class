print("forgot the latin word or name for this condition")
print("said I feel sick to get attention!")
print("now that it's winter got an excuse to not go home.")
print("rented a house out on the coast")

print("If I was in London I'd hold you to everything")
print("If I was in Cardiff I'd just sing.")
